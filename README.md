# Lurker Grimoire

## Description & Legal
First and foremost, this project is a personal LaTeX playground for me to test out templates.<br/>
<br/>
This project publicly has no licensing aside from the minimum rights (Public views and forks) stated in Github's ToS.<br/>
While I do support open source projects, I do not believe that modifying or viewing my bad templates (Or forking it regarding that matter) will make any sense, so the licensing is the strictest possible. The possibility of me violating my own work's copyright is also zero as I will not accept public contributions or pull requests for this project.<br/>
<br/>
Second, this is also a place for me to write a constantly updated book, the contents of which I retain full copyright of. So given that all of the code part is basically useless and the content part is copyrighted, no licensing works best. Or in other words, "All rights reserved".<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, while forking the repository is *technically* permitted by Github ToS, I don't particularly want my book to have old copies being forked and tossed around even for the sake of keeping history. Of course, modifying the contents of the forked repository is of course a violation of the licensing agreements stated.
