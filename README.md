# Lurker Grimoire

First and foremost, this project is a personal LaTeX playground for me to test out templates.
This project publicly has no licensing aside from the minimum rights (Public views and forks) stated in Github's ToS.
While I do support open source projects, I do not believe that modifying or viewing my bad templates (Or forking it regarding that matter) will make any sense, so the licensing is the strictest possible.
